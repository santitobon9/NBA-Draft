Luka Doncic|Point Guard|Real Madrid|18|6'8"|2|"Though he's only 18 years old and is playing against tougher competition compared to the NCAA, Doncic has been as consistently effective as any top college prospect"
Marvin Bagley|Power Forward|Duke|18|6'11"|3|"Marvin Bagley is just one of those players who will be productive regardless of situation."|
Mohamed Bama|Center|Texas|19|7'0"|4|"Bamabe's unicorn potential gives him arguably the highest upside of any player in this draft"|
Micheal Porter jr|Small Forward|Missouri|19|6'10"|5|"As long as his medicals check out, his size, shooting and polished game should keep him pretty safely among the draft's early selections"|
Trae Young|Point Guard|Oklahoma|19|6'2"|6|"There's mixed opinion surrounding his long-term prospect, but he comes with star-level potential if everything breaks right, able to rain threes from deep,utilize high ball screens and find teammates"|
Jaren Jackson Jr|Power Forward|Michigan State|18|6'11"|7|"His 7'4" wingspan and defensive instincts combine to create a monster in protection. But he's also shooting 44.1 percent from three and 79.1 at the free-throw line"|

Collin Sexton|Point Guard|Alabama|19|6'3"|10|"looks like a nice pairing with his tremendous aggressiveness driving the lane, taking off-the-dribble jumpers and putting defensive pressure on opposing guards"|
Miles Bridges|Small Forward|Michigan State|20|6'7"|11|"Bridges brings athleticism, toughness and some shot-making ability on the wing, with potential to become a plus 3-and-D guy in the right situation"|
Kevin Knox|Power Forward|Kentucky|18|6'9"|12|"Knox hasn't had a very efficient freshman season, partially due to his playing out of position, but there's a siginficant market in the NBA for combo forwards in his mold who can make an open shot, defend multiple positions and offer some offensive versatility"|
